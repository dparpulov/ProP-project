# ProP-project
Fontys First Year ProP project

This is a project I and 3 others did in the first year of my ICT and Software engineering studies in Fontys university. 

The project includes a website where people can look up info about a music festival, register, buy tickets, deposit money(not real),
reserve a campspot and other things.
The project also includes:
1 master application from which the other apps can be accessed.
1 app from which users can register and buy tickets
4 apps to get in/out of the festival and camping area (1 app for each activity)
2 apps for the shops and loaning stands (1 app for the different shops and 1 for the different loaning stands)
1 overview application where information about the event can be found

I worked on the register/buy tickets app, check-in/out of the festival and camping area apps, on the database and a little bit on the shops. I used RFID chip and reader to simulate getting in with a bracelet.

I was the project leader in this project. As such I had to keep track of what is going on and push the group to progress further. I also had to communicate with our mentor about the progress and work load on each member of the group. Learned a lot about managing such a project.
