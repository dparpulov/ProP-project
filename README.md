# ProP-project
Fontys First Year ProP project

This is a project I and 3 others did in the first year of my ICT and Software engineering studies in Fontys university. 

The project includes a website where people can look up info about a music festival, register, buy tickets, deposit money(not real),
reserve a campspot and other things.
The project also includes 1 master application from which the other apps can be accessed. Users can also register from one of the apps,
get in/out of the festival and camping area, use shops and loaning stands. there is also an overview app where information about the
event can be found.
