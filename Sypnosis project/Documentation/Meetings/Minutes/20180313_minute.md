Notes

Questions
---------
- Do we need a venue and stage table in the database?
	- Leave it out, if we need it later we can refer back to the design.
- Should we add a permission table for specific permissions connected to a role table?
	- Either have groups with set permissions or do it your way, both are fine.
- How many shops are there?
	- 3 shops, at least more than 2.
- Are shops that sell and rent separated or can a shop offer both?
	- They are separate.
- Do we have to make visual designs for everything?
	- No, just 2 or 3. At least one very well done.
- Visual design feedback?
	- Likes it. Maybe make one more for pages that have a different layout.
	- Maybe give it a background, not leave it white.
- Gantt Chart feedback?
	- It's ok that it's not detailed, because we have a ToDo list.
	- We can use the MoSCoW list in the setup document to make it more detailed.
	- Add tasks for application development.
	- Final Setup Document task.
	- Final Process Report task.

Feedback
--------
- Make an additional layout to present to the client.
