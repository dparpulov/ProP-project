Notes
=====
Questions
---------
- Should locations of stores be stored in the database?
	- No, an interactive map is an interesting feature (could have).
- How to construct the ERD for things like food, drinks and rentables.
	- Think about it from query perspective, will the database design cause problems in any way? Maybe make multiple solutions and when it's time to impement in block 2, we can pick one then.
- Are there ticket types for example 1-day, 2-day and 3-day tickets?
	- No, to keep it simple, only have tickets for whole weekend. But it could be an extra feature (would have or could have).
- Feedback on process report?
	- Change it to an markdown (.md) file, add a GANT-chart with weighted tasks (effort needed). Keep the process report updated weekly.
- Feedback on wireframes?
	- Wireframes are good and sitemap is good. Might need additional pages later but those can be added later.
- What's the maximum amount of items that can be loaned?
	- Make it so the limit can be configurated from the application or website (up to us from which one).
- Project Plan v2 feedback
	- Add actual dates to phasing, fairly good sections.
	- Website development is during this milestone.
	- Application development next milestone.
	- List of tasks missing.
	- Feel free to add a summary and an appendix with more detail if it's too detailed.
	- Add visual design if it's done.
- Do we have to make use-cases for all processes for the setup document?
	- No, just the common processes (2 or 3 for each member)
- Is the README file good enough?
	- It's good enough, add the logo to it though.
	
Feedback
--------
- Is there a page for employees to manage the site (add users, remove users, etc.)?
	- No. Database to be changed: account_type, employee_type, permission.
