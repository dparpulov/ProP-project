# ProP-project
Fontys First Year ProP project

This is a project I and 3 others did in the first year of my ICT and Software engineering studies in Fontys university. 

The project includes a website where people can look up info about a music festival, register, buy tickets, deposit money(not real),
reserve a campspot and other things.
The project also includes 1 master application from which the other apps can be accessed. Users can also register from one of the apps,
get in/out of the festival and camping area, use shops and loaning stands. there is also an overview app where information about the
event can be found.

I worked on the check-in/out of the festival and camping area apps, on the database and a little bit on the shops. I used RFID chip and reader to simulate getting in with a bracelet.

I was the project leader in this project. As such I had to keep track of what is going on and push the group to proceed further. I also had to communicate with our mentor about the progress and work load on each of us.
